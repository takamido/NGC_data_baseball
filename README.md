## NGC analysis of the interaction between pitchers and batters in baseball
Tis repository contains code and datasets for a NGC analysis of the interaction between pitchers and batters in baseball [1]. 

The method was originally proposed by Tank et al [2], and this repository was also developed based on the original repository (https://github.com/iancovert/Neural-GC). 

## Contents
-input_datasets: pre-processed motion capture data of baseball pitcher and batter. The detailes are provided bellow.

-models: machine learning model for NGC analysis imported from the original repository.

-NGC_analysis.ipynb: sample code for the NGC analysis with input_datasets. You can run this code in Google Colaboratory or other applications.
